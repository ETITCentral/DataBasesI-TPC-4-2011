[2. Introducci√≥n BD: SGBD y tipos.](./Lessons/2.%20DB-intro.pdf)

## Objective

Provide students with a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of databases, including their modeling, querying, and use in information systems. Students will learn how to apply this knowledge to design and develop information systems that respond to specific requirements, using relational databases in a transactional multi-user environment.

#### Subject Learning Results (RAC)

At the end of the course the student will be able to:

**RAC 1:** Identify, describe, and explain basic concepts of data bases: entities, attributes, relationships, and keys in the context of relational databases.

**RAC 2:** Apply normalization techniques to organize and design efficient and consistent databases.

**RAC 3:** Develop and execute database queries using SQL, interacting effectively with database management systems.

These learning outcomes ensure that students have the technical and analytical skills necessary to manage databases in real-world applications and develop software solutions that effectively utilize databases.

For all periods the grade is divided into: Co-evaluation (10 %), self-evaluation (10 %), and teacher evaluation (80 %) which is divided into exams (40 %) and assignments (40 %). The first and second periods are 35 % of the final grade, while for the last period it is 30 %. In the first and second periods the exam consists of two tests: one practical (60 %) and the other theoretical (40 %). 

The project is divide in two grades: first report (20 %) and last (80 %) assignment.

**Note:** You can practice and complement the course by solving programming problems in any of the following pages:

- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

Each solved problem, which has passed all the tests created for the page, can be exchanged for points. Very simple problems are not valid.
